🧾 Description:

FoodReel is a full-stack Zomato-inspired MERN application that combines food discovery with social media-style engagement. Built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, it allows food partners to upload restaurant videos in a “Reels” format, giving users a dynamic and immersive way to explore dishes, places, and local food stories.

🍔 Food Partner Portal: Create, manage, and showcase food items or dishes.

🎥 Reels-Style Video Feed: Infinite scroll video feed built with React and Node, allowing quick previews of dishes.

🔒 User Authentication: Secure login & signup using JWT and bcrypt.
